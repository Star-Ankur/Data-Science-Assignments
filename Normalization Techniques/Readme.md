Generally the real world data obtained is very irregular.
Some fields can have huge variance or have or have a high offset value than the others.
The features with higher values will always dominate the learning process.
Normalization gives equal importance to each variable so that no single variable drives the model performance
Here we discuss three important normalization techniques:
1. Maximum Absolute Scaling
2. Min Max Scaling
3. z-score Method
